Run `npm run init` to install all package dependancies in the corresponding project root directories and build the ui library

Run `npm run start-demo` to start the demo application 

Run `npm run build-ui-lib` to rebuild the ui-lib after code changes, the build will be stored in `dist/`

The demo has two pages and the whole styling is done using material components and material theming

    1. Material and Custom: Demonstrates a combination of a custom ui element and a material element referencing materials theming combined in one library component
